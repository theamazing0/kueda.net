title: "Ken-ichi's Website"
---

Welcome. I am Ken-ichi Ueda, a real person in Oakland, California. I have a website because sometimes I want to say things to the entire world, but also because I need a job to make money to pay the bills for the goods and services that allow me to live and I guess if you say that you're a web developer you should have a site on the web that you developed. I don't know how to hunt, forage, farm, etc, so [I really need that money](/work).

Like many 90s-vintage nerds, I'm a techno-optimist. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I think computers are cool and useful and help us do good things. They have helped me learn about the non-human world, make friends, and maybe even change my mind for the better. Pretty hot take in {% include current_year.html %}, right?

If you've heard of me it's probably because I co-founded [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) and then spent 17 years working on it, but did you also know that I really like Star Trek? I do. Even though I always lose at Star Trek trivia. I also like Babylon 5 but there is no regular Babylon 5 trivia night I can lose at.

I used to love social media, but then it got scary. Rarely, but on occasion, I post to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kueda.net) (too public), [Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@kueda) (also too public), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi) (too Amazon), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/ken-ichi) (do I even photo?), and yes, [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/kueda) (not rarely, natural history addiction disorder, help me). I guess since, like I said, I need money, I should also say I am on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kueda/).

That's all. I hope you like my website.
