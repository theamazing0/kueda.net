As of January 2026, I need a job. You can review my professional and educational history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kueda/). You can review my code (both professional and personal) at [Github](https://github.com/kueda). If I seem like the kind of person you might hire, contact me at [work@kueda.net](mailto:work@kueda.net).

I'm looking for something that combines my interest in technology with natural history, but tech + literature / comics / food / democracy / social media / etc all sound interesting too. I'm mainly hoping for a way to pay my bills that I don't feel terrible about.

My most monetizable skill is being able to write code, mostly Ruby, Javascript and its ilk, some Python, even less Rust. I'm best on the frontend, but I've worked at most levels of the web stack. I spent quite a bit of the end of my time at iNat working on internationalization and translation management and integration. I'm also a decent writer, perhaps a reasonable editor, an enthusiastic skeptic, and have moderate familiarity with biology, California natural history, and biodiversity informatics if we still call it that.
